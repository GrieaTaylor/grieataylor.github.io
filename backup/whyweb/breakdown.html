<span class="oboldlil">Buy Less and Buy Better</span><br>

This is a concept that Lucy Siegle explores in her book To Die For: Is Fashion Wearing Out the World? “A staggering one-and-a-half-billion pairs of jeans and cotton trousers are sewn in Bangladesh every year," she points out. So perhaps we don't need ten pairs of jeans, just one really good pair.
<br><br><br>

<span class="oboldlil">
 Extend the lifecycle of your clothing</span><br>

"Doubling the useful life of clothing from one year to two years reduces emissions over the year by 24%,” according to Fashion Revolution.
<br><br><br>

<span class="oboldlil">Recycle Unwanted Garments</span><br>

According to Ragtrader, Australians discard 23 kilograms of clothing per capita every year. Which is why recycling our clothes properly is crucial for saving the planet.
<br><br><br>
<span class="oboldlil">Develop a personal uniform</span><br>

In the context of our choice society, we are constantly buying new clothes that we don’t need. So why not focus on developing a personal uniform instead? Maya Singer puts it eloquently when she says: “as a lover of fashion, I’d like to promote the idea that having a sense of style is a way of taking action: If you’re finicky in your taste, fussy about the way your clothes are made, and curatorial in your approach to putting together a wardrobe, that’s a pretty good defense against the temptation to buy some piece of tat, you know, just because."
